# Coding-Quiz


## Description

This is a project for a coding quiz. It is scored only through speed of completion and point deduction from wrong answers. Essentially the remaining time is the final score of the user. Upon completion, the user is taken to a second page where they are able to submit a name to be displayed with their score. Both the name and score are stored in the local storage.

## Usage

This project can be used to test a very basic web development knowledge. It only consists of 5 total question, all of which are quite simple.
